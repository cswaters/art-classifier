    "## Classify Artistic Styles\n",

    "The simple model below classifies a painting as one of four artistic *movements*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Futurism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism): A early 20th century movement, started in Italy, celebrating speed, technology, and industrialization.\n",
    "- [Cubism](https://mymodernmet.com/what-is-cubism-art/): A style characterized by fragmented subject matter deconstructed in such a way that it can be viewed from multiple angles simultaneously.\n",
    "- [Impressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism): A 19th-century art movement characterized by small, thin, visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light and its changing qualities.\n",
    "- [Neo-expressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-expressionism) A style of late modernist or early-postmodern painting characterized by intense subjectivity and rough handling of materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "*note: the model only classifies a painting as one of those four styles. A picture of your cat, or a stick figuring won't generate meaningful results*\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is surprisingly accurate given the limtited training data and overlapping styles. Often what seperates a movement is the year a painting was produced or the location of creation. For example, Cubism and Futurism often look similar, yet the model does a good job of seperating them into the categories determined by art historians and critics."
